      "I'm a middle manager. I had two of my workers ask for a larger raise than they received. I supported it and the uppers didn't. When they didn't get the raise they wanted I had a heart to heart with both of them. They both talked to me about the job offers they received over the next few months. Each one used me as a reference and they got 20%-30% raises by leaving. Since I knew they were shopping around it wasn't a surprise and I was able to plan how to shift work around easier than if I only had two weeks notice. \n",

For example, one employee really enjoys data visualization, but it isn't part of his job description.

Luckily at my last job I was WFH a majority of the time, and most interviews were virtual so I didn’t have to actually take time off. I’d just block time off on my calendar so my boss assumed I was in an internal meeting or had a working block, and take my interview. I would be careful to not be too “done up” for any on-camera meetings before or after my interview. One time I had a meeting right after an interview so I literally hopped off the interview zoom, threw a sweatshirt on over my blouse, threw my hair up in a messy bun, and removed my jewelry.\n",

      "Pre-WFH times, I once had an on-site interview at like 9am, across town. At the time it was absolutely abnormal for me arrive late and I often arrived early. So I went to my office around 8am as per usual. At 8:30 I had a friend call me and pretended it was my building’s maintenance guy needing access to my apartment. “Shit guys, I totally forgot my landlord was sending someone to look at my fridge this morning. I have to run home and let the guy in.”\n",

      "If you're trying to stay under the radar, then don't change your routine.  If you never take lunches but all of a sudden need 90 minutes to take lunch, that's a huge red flag.  If you always take long lunches then don't all of a sudden be a model employee.\n",
      "The usual not meeting deadlines, drop in performance and all, but twice it was because they left a tab open about a job search - one was already in another job and got a work message while she was screensharing.\n",

      "Everyone that has left under my management came to me and told me that they were looking for another job months ahead of their departure.  Most of these people were promoted out in house.  I've taken my own personal time to help certain members of my team with their interview skills.\n",
      "If you have to ask, then bet that they already are. If you want to keep people, pay them better and don't do that thing where you just spread people's responsibilities around after someone quits rather than replace them.

I think it’s good that he’s looking to move on, and will support him in doing so! This was a skip-level meeting, which means he doesn’t report directly to me, so I notified his manager that it may be something to keep an eye on in terms of capacity planning for our team.

If they were close by, I'd use my hour lunch to hit the interview. If I absolutely could not do this and it was a job I was fairly certain I wanted to go in for, I would have a \"dentist appointment\" or \"doctor appointment\" I couldn't miss or an emergency visit that needed to happen (one of them wasn't faked; my filling fell out of my tooth while at work, so I needed an actual visit LOL). They did begin to get suspicious after a bit of these though so try and keep these to a dull roar...and I don't advocate lying per se, but it's not a bad idea to have a doctor or dentist note around in case they ask for proof at some point. (Mine never did but I did have one from each place). Watch out for the online job boards too...I went to post my resume on a popular one and lo and behold I found them advertising MY job there at one place.
