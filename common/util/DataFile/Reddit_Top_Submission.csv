2022-08-24,wvcygt,597,How do you keep going?,"I (22 M) have trouble with jobs. I’m a hard worker, and I’m motivated, so I’ve landed roughly ten jobs in the last year, but I quit all of them within a month. Some after a day. They were crappy jobs. Thing is, didn’t matter if the pay was great, I just couldn’t stick to it.

I didn’t attend college. I have 2 retail jobs right now and I’m getting paid pretty well at both of them, still in training. I am very scared of messing it all up again. 

I understand that in order to live you have to work, but eating ants seems more attractive than spending time doing this. I’m not suggesting I’m special, because I’m not. But those of you who do this consistently, ya’ll are special, and I need to know how you do it because I’m losing my mind

Edit: Thank you all for the flood of advice, support and criticism, I’m using every drop of it as I move forward. My appreciation cannot be measured for it.

wonderful feeling more importantly once you get that reward if you suddenly start seeing the nest egg diminish it terrifies you this is why cant stand the thought of quitting without better job lined

do the job then yell at you for mistakes long hours with no breaks like 6 hrs at least and work hours that prevent you from having second job or doing something else productive with your time an

get hired you become disconnected for some reason pay doesn seem to be the issue because you say you have quit good paying jobs if it isn money or pay could it be purpose maybe the work just doesn appeal to you once you figure this out then you can start down the path of getting career that you are going to stick around in for long period of time until you do then you will be just going from

terrible at hiring qualified candidates it horrible know feel like being driven insane seriously it is getting to the point where getting so frustrated and angry with these people that walk away because otherwise might hurt them it is so frustrating because often times they can see more qualified than they are so they are intimidated and try to beat me down or won hire me giving me line of being over qualified don even get me started on the idiots still wearing masks when everyone has stopped wearing them throughout the community including many of their own customers it insanity tell ya feel your pain hopefully they start replacing the terrible managers soon and get some real leadership back in their proper roles my advice just try to be in place that doesn stress you out usually that means working with people that support you and you can get along with usually easier if you are in an industry providing good or service that makes people happy negativity feeds negativity and it

more had no idea how much miss speaking to people when did different job where that wasn so much thing that could happen have several years of warehouse and much fewer years of retail in all that time

something called consultant analyst where companies come to you and you set up and flesh out their data pipelines and visualizations and all of that and that what aiming for in the near future point

number comes from my therapist btw talking about how authenticity makes you feel alive but that life still does have paperwork or less interesting aspects too one benefit of schooling or apprenticeship of any form is that you get to explore lots of different areas you get to try out new things and see what resonates with you sometimes you might find something traditional maybe electronics or making physical objects and sometimes it might be really unconventional freelance doing specialty props and special effects for film and theater never thought be doing that lol but it turns out that what really love doing explore whether you like working solo or with team do you like entertaining people do you like constant repeating tasks or do you like novelty what if you ran your own online business for something that really mattered to you once you connect to what makes you feel alive it lot easier to find work that incorporates it and you can do hybrid approach maybe you work retail part time while you start up your own business or take night hobby classes while working full time maybe you trade the equivalent of food and rent to apprentice at place you find really interesting or trade services with someone who has skill you want to learn something that really helped me was the phrase is what doing right now going to move me toward where really want to be

at peace and alive and life felt great it took me 2 3 days on vacation to turn off the anxiety and being on and everything that my job causes me to be everyday then was back at work beginning monday and it was back to the grind back to having my whole day eaten up by work and meetings back to being on back to only having the evening hours and weekends but being too tired to do much and strategizing ways to make even more money to retire earlier point is you can have goal of early retirement but that it any job you get will likely be shit and am college educated with good paying job and still think this way no matter how simple or complex at the end of the day there are bills to pay in order to survive it really doesn matter if you can live as minimalist you still need money for basic needs the only goal you can make is to plan out your financial future and needs and try to work as many high paying jobs in order to get the most money you can get in order to retire earlier ppl
